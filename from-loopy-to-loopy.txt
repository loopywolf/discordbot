I got into a real mess with GIT, so here's what I ask you do next time:
1. A request from fatrobin - work on a branch (like at work)
2. you are working with git, so remember to check your git status (git pull?) before you touch any code
3. Always remember to check that what you are playing with works before changing, PLEASE
4. the steps are:
- git pull
- git commit
- git push

From your codemonkey (2022-10-26):
  git status
    <if there are differences, you may want to pull>
  git pull
    <create a new branch>
  git checkout -b BRANCH
    <code like it was dec.31st 1999>
  git add . --all
  git commit -a
  git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH
    <if code is solid, you can do the following below>
  git checkout master
  git merge BRANCH
  git push
