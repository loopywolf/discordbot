I got into a real mess with GIT, so here's what I ask you do next time:
1. A request from fatrobin - work on a branch (like at work)
2. you are working with git, so remember to check your git status (git pull?) before you touch any code
3. Always remember to check that what you are playing with works before changing, PLEASE
4. the steps are:
- git pull
- git commit
- git push
